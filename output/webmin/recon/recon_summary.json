The next logical step in the penetration testing process would be to research known vulnerabilities for Apache 2.4.58 and Webmin 1.910. You can use public vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, Exploit-DB) to identify potential exploits or misconfigurations. Additionally, consider attempting default credential attacks or brute-forcing login pages if applicable.",
