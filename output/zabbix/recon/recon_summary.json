  "next_step": "The reconnaissance phase has identified two open HTTP ports. Port 80 is running Apache 2.4.58 on Ubuntu. Port 8080 is running Zabbix 3.0.3, which is served by Apache 2.4.33 and utilizes PHP 5.6.36. The next steps should focus on researching known vulnerabilities for Zabbix 3.0.3, PHP 5.6.36, and the identified Apache versions. Additionally, attempting to find default credentials for Zabbix or exploring common Zabbix misconfigurations would be a logical progression for further investigation.",
