For the Apache HTTP service, consider using directory brute-forcing tools like `gobuster` or `dirb` to discover hidden directories or files. For the Redis service, investigate potential unauthenticated access or known vulnerabilities in Redis 5.0.7. You could also attempt to interact with Redis using `redis-cli` if direct access is permitted.",
